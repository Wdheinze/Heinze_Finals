# Heinze_Finals
Finally, Finals. XD 
Finals was super duper fun. Throughout this semseter I have just been following the guidelines on what to do for projects/homework
So to be honest I was quite lost when it came down to having to do my own project with no guidance. I first thought that a videogame would 
be fun but then I realized that I did really enjoy making these fun websites. I decided for my finals I would do an adoption website.
Then it came down to what was it I wanted to have be adopted? I thought first that just dogs and cats would be fun but then I came up
with the idea for a magical creature adoption website.

Coding this was fun. I enjoyed being able to use Jquery again and get the professors help on a few things. Overall this class was very
relaxing and fun. I know that I will be able to achieve great things with the information that I have learned over this semester. Thank you.
